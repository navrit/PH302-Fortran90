 

 Here are the coefficients of the quadratic equation
 a =    2.000000    
 b =   -12.00000    
 c =    18.00000    
 
 Here is the positive x value :    3.000000    
 Here is the negative x value :    0.000000    
 
 If either of the above values are 0.0 or NaN
 there is not a real root for that value
