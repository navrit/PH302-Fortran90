PROGRAM assign_2_2
  
  IMPLICIT NONE
  
  !a,b,c are variables and are initialised here
  !discrim will store the answer

  REAL :: a,b,c,discrim,x_plus,x_neg
  
  a = 0 !!Initial conditions
  b = 0
  c = 0

  OPEN(99,FILE='assign_2_2.out')

  WRITE(*,*) 'a = what??'
  READ(*,*) a
  WRITE(*,*) 'b = what??'
  READ(*,*) b
  WRITE(*,*) 'c = what??'
  READ(*,*) c

  discrim = b**2 - 4*a*c !To calculate the discriminant


  x_plus = (-b + SQRT(discrim))/(2*a) !Calculates the positive x solution to the quadratic equation
  x_neg = (-b - SQRT(discrim))/(2*a) !Calculates the negative x solution to the quadratic equation


  WRITE (99,*) "Here are the coefficients of the quadratic equation"
  WRITE (99,*) "a = ",a
  WRITE (99,*) "b = ",b
  WRITE (99,*) "c = ",c

  WRITE (99,*) "Here is the postive x value dude : ",x_plus !
  WRITE (99,*) "Here is the negative x value dude : ",x_neg !


  CLOSE(99)
