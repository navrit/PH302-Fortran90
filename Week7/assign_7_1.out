 |  TEST NUMBER           1 |
 +--------------------------+
 Calling your subroutine to solve the equation:
 0 = (2.0)x^2 + (-5.5)x + (-1.5)
 ie: A = 2.0  B = -5.5  C = -1.5
 Attempting to call your subroutine...
 ...Back out of your subroutine. It returned the following values for number of solutions, xplus and xminus:
           2   3.000000     -0.2500000    
 Your subroutine claims there are two solutions, which is correct
 Your subroutine found the first solution for x to be    3.000000     , which is correct
 Your subroutine found the second solution for x to be  -0.2500000     , which is correct
 +--------------------------+
 |         SUCCESS!         |

 +--------------------------+
 |  TEST NUMBER           2 |
 +--------------------------+
 Calling your subroutine to solve the equation:
 0 = (4.0)x^2 + (16.0)x + (16.0)
 ie: A = 4.0  B = 16.0  C = 16.0
 Attempting to call your subroutine...
 ...Back out of your subroutine. It returned the following values for number of solutions, xplus and xminus:
           1  -2.000000       0.000000    
 Your subroutine claims there is one solution, which is correct
 Your subroutine found the solution for x to be   -2.000000     , which is correct
 +--------------------------+
 |         SUCCESS!         |

 |  TEST NUMBER           3 |
 +--------------------------+
 Calling your subroutine to solve the equation:
 0 = (3.0)x^2 + (5.0)x + (12.0)
 ie: A = 3.0  B = 5.0  C = 12.0
 Attempting to call your subroutine...
 ...Back out of your subroutine. It returned the following values for number of solutions, xplus and xminus:
           0   0.000000       0.000000    
 Your subroutine claims there are no solutions, which is correct
 +--------------------------+
 |         SUCCESS!         |
