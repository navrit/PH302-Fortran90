1. INTENT(OUT)
	eg. {variable type}, INTENT(OUT) :: {variable name}

2. Functions have a return type, they must return a variable of a predefined type. 
    Sub-routines are called by using the CALL command, functions are referred to by just 
    their name.
	eg. CALL {subroutine(...parameters...)}
		or
	    {function(...parameters...)}

3. Using functions and sub-routines can reduce the repetitiveness of the program by re-using
    code. They can also greatly simplify understanding and the readability of the program to
    programmers, which can also help with debugging.
