1.	Computational problem : Input any number which has an exponent of more
							than 1023 or less than -1022
	Physics problem 	  : If the y velocity is above 0.1c, then 
							relativistic effects would start to dominate

2.	A - Relativistic effects could be taken into account
	B - It could be extended into an n-body simulation of many electrons
		simultaneously along with not assuming that the alpha particle 
		will not move at all.

3.	The majority of the program could be wrapped by a DO loop which repeats
	the program from where it gets user input to the end as many times as 
	there are different x displacements. This section would not include when
	the program asks for the velocities. Instead of asking for x 
	displacements, it would of course read them in from the file.
	
4.	Comparison to actual experimental data would be the best way of 
	determining the validity of the simulation. After all, that is precisely
	what the program is meant to simulate - reality.
